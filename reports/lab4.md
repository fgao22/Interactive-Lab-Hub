# Paper Puppets

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors


**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Red - 5V
Brown - Ground
Yellow - Signal

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

Pin 9

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The increment of the for loop affects the speed of sweep. The range of angle we write to the Servo determines the angle of the sweep.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**




## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**
